I was so so happy as soon as we walked in because it was winter time and the lobby was nicely heated up and they had a lift which is not something most buildings in Kathmandu have. Check-in was quick and smooth, we arrived early and were allowed to go to our rooms since it was available. The room was huge and came with a king-sized bed, very well furnished and had a great bathroom and a nice warm shower. It was ULTRA clean and looked almost as though we were the first ones to ever sleep in that room. They also have their own generator which is really helpful especially when Kathmandu could experience a couple of power shortages in 1 day. We had room service that evening and their penne was on point! Breakfast was also delicious and the hotel staff were always happy to go the extra mile and stop for a chat . Definitely a place I would highly recommend!  "
